# Graphs
Before we get into graph traversal algorithms like the breadth-first-search, we have to know what graphs are in the context of discrete mathematics.
A graph is a way of **representing relationships** that **exists between pairs of objects**. Do NOT confuse graphs in this context to function plots, bar charts, etc. Those are different!

Abstractly, a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a set V of **vertices** (or nodes) and a set E of pairs of vertices from V called edges (or links)

For example, $G = (V, E)$, where
* $V = \{ a,\ b,\ c, \ d \}$  
* $E = \{(a, b),\ (b, c),\ (a, c),\ (d, d) \}$

The elements of $V$ are our nodes/vertices, and the elements of E are edges/links.
These edges could be _**directed**_ or **_undirected_**
